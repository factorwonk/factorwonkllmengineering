      "🔥 Small tweaks, massive speedup! I optimized a pose estimation pipeline and took it from 9 FPS → 47 FPS!\n",
      "\n",
      "I used 🤗 Transformers with RT-DETR as the detector and ViTPose for keypoint detection. Initially, it ran at 117ms per frame (~9 FPS) on my GPU, too slow for real-time applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 What is ViTPose, and why do we need a detector?\n",
      "ViTPose is a top-down pose estimation model that works on cropped images of people rather than the full scene. It requires a detector like RT-DETR to first locate individuals before estimating their keypoints.\n",
      "This top-down approach allows for multi-person pose estimation and typically yields higher accuracy. However, it can be computationally expensive when dealing with multiple people, as ViTPose needs to process each crop separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚡ Optimizing the Pipeline\n",
      "By applying 4 key optimizations, I achieved 22ms per frame (~47 FPS)! Here’s what made the difference:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Lower precision (FP32 → BF16/FP16) for better hardware utilization.\n",
      "✅ Optimizing the model with torch.compile, 🤗 Transformers models are already designed to avoid graph breaks, making them well-suited for compilation.\n",
      "✅ Using the ‘fast’ image processor from 🤗 Transformers (torch-based instead of numpy-based).\n",
      "✅ Rewriting preprocessing with `roi_align` for more efficient crop extraction and resizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally, I just wanted to squeeze out a little more speed, but I didn’t expect to 5x the FPS with just a few tweaks!\n",

       "## Welcome to Hugging Face!\n",
       "\n",
       "### Where AI Meets Affection\n",
       "At Hugging Face, we're not just building AI; we're building a community that's as warm and fuzzy as our name suggests. Welcome to the future of machine learning, where we brainstorm models, datasets, and applications faster than you can say “artificial intelligence is more than just complicated math!”\n",
       "\n",
       "### Our Customers: A Star-Studded Lineup!\n",
       "Over **50,000 organizations** are cuddling up with us! Our clients range from **Google**, **AI at Meta**, **Amazon Web Services**, to **Microsoft**—basically, the A-Team of tech! We might not be giving them actual hugs, but we provide the next best thing: high-performance AI models and data galore!\n",
       "\n",
       "### What We Offer: Models, Datasets & More!\n",
       "- **1M+ Models**: Looking for a model to wear? We don’t have fashion models, but we do have AI models ready to strut their stuff!\n",
       "- **250k+ Datasets**: Our datasets are like a treasure trove waiting to be discovered! (Shovel not included.) \n",
       "- **Spaces**: It’s not just ‘Outer Space’ – it’s our collaborative playground where you can launch your AI creations into the universe!\n",
       "\n",
       "### Our Culture: Open, Friendly, and Slightly Nerdy\n",
       "At Hugging Face, we believe in **collaboration**, **openness**, and **a good cup of coffee**. Join our team of AI enthusiasts who prefer hugging models to hugging trees. Our culture is as vibrant as our codebase; think **hackathons** where high-fives are mandatory and the only time you’ll hear “you can’t do that” is during flip cup!\n",
       "\n",
       "### Careers: Join the Hug Life\n",
       "Are you looking for a job that’s as fun as a puppy pile? We’re on the lookout for:\n",
       "- **AI Magicians**: Turn data into gold—figuratively, of course.\n",
       "- **Model Whisperers**: For when model training becomes a therapy session.\n",
       "- **Data Ninjas**: Stealthily navigating through datasets like a pro!\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pricing: Pay Less, Hug More!\n",
       "- **Compute**: Starting at just **$0.60/hour for GPU!** (That's like, cheaper than your morning coffee at that hipster café! ☕)\n",
       "- **Enterprise Solutions**: From **$20/user/month**, because AI and a cozy hug don't have to break the bank!\n",
       "\n",
       "### Join Us!\n",
       "Are you ready to embrace the Hugging Face revolution? With a mission to make machine learning more accessible than ever, let’s take the leap together! Whether you’re looking to innovate, invest, or grab a coding job, we’ve got a space for you.\n",
