       "Alright, so I need to condense this detailed plot summary into an elevator pitch that references other well-known movies or IPs. The example given was for \"Speed\" using \"Die Hard.\" Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, the story involves Deputy Marshal Madelyn Harris escorting a criminal named Winston to testify against a mob boss. On their plane ride, they discover a pilot who's a Hitman sent by Moretti to kill Winston. They manage to incapacitate him and fly to Anchorage for the trial.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the air, the Hitman taunts her about an incident where she was in charge of a girl who was being hunted by the cartel, leading to her demotion because she couldn't protect her. The Hitman stabs Winston twice but is killed when he hits a truck on landing. Madelyn then has to tend to Winston's wounds and realize that the mole in the FBI is her boss, Deputy Director Coleridge.\n",
       "\n",
       "I need to find references from similar genres or key elements. The action elements are present—trials, hitmen, danger. The plot involves covert ops, which ties into something like \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\" since it's a mix of action and sci-fi with ghostbusting. \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" also has action and betrayals.\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking at the movie tags provided by the assistant—JOHN WICK: Chapter 4, HIT MAN, GHOSTBUSTERS: Frozen Empire, GLASS ONION, TRIANGLE OF SADNESS—it seems like GHOSTBUSTERS is a good fit because of the sci-fi elements with ghostbusting and action. The plot involves a rescue mission against mobsters, similar to how Ghostbusters deal with ghosts in space.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, the key theme here is betrayal among law enforcement, which reminds me of \"GLASS ONION,\" but that might not be as relevant. Instead, maybe using \"Hit Man\" itself or another action thriller.\n",
       "\n",
       "Putting it all together: An action-packed rescue mission where a deputy marshal must fight a web of betrayals and danger to clear her name and expose a high-ranking mobster. The mention of GHOSTBUSTERS gives it a sci-fi twist, which aligns with the detailed plot elements provided.\n",
       "</think>\n",
       "\n",
       "An elite rescue mission in the heart of chaos, where a deputy marshal faces a web of betrayal and danger to clear her name against a high-ranking mobster. Join Deputy Marshal Madelyn Harris as she leads a daring operation to protect her loved ones while confronting a treacherous alliance that threatens everything she holds dear. This thrilling tale weaves a suspenseful narrative of sacrifice, loyalty, and justice in the face of intense danger, set against a backdrop of intrigue and danger reminiscent of a gritty action thriller with a touch of sci-fi flair."
